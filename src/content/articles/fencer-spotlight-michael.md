# From the Sofa to the Piste; Fencer Spotlight: Michael

Among the active senior fencers in the club, a young 18 year-old member stands out. Michael Lin is currently the number 1 ranked fencer in the Saigon Fencing Club (SFC). This Saigon South International School (SSIS) senior showcased his fencing journey that started long before he arrived in Vietnam.

Michael's path started with a simple, relatable problem: two young boys with a lot of energy. When he was just seven, his mom encouraged him and his older brother, Nick, to find a hobby that would keep them from fighting at home. Fencing turned out to be the perfect solution. What began as a way to make sibling squabbles productive quickly blossomed into a shared passion.

They fell in love with it. They started making lots of friends in the fencing community and even joined their elementary school's varsity team. Soon, fencing wasn't just a hobby, it became an integral part of their lives. The sport lead them to local tournaments and exciting summer camps abroad.

## International Competition and Leadership

Now living in Saigon, Michael has continued to refine his skills. And just this past March, he proudly represented the Saigon Fencing Club at the 4th Western Cup in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He was able to apply his skills on an international stage. But more than just competing, he's also taken on a leadership role at his school, founding the SSIS fencing club to share his passion and mentor the next generation of fencers.

## More Than Just Competition

Fencing has become a pathway for Michael to grow, not just as an athlete but as a person. The sport has taught him discipline, focus, and the ability to think quickly under pressure—skills that are just as vital in life as they are on the fencing strip. Through years of competition, he has learned to handle both the thrill of victory and the lessons that come with defeat. His top ranking isn't just a number; it's a testament to his dedication and serves as a powerful inspiration for every fencer at the club.
